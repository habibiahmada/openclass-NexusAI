## Issues Found
- ❌ Response time exceeds 5 second threshold
- ❌ Memory usage exceeds 4GB threshold
- ❌ Curriculum alignment below 85% threshold
- ❌ model_manager: Failed to initialize: argument should be a str or an os.PathLike object where __fspath__ returns a str, not 'ConfigurationManager'
- ❌ inference_engine: Failed to initialize: InferenceEngine.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'config'
- ❌ rag_pipeline: Failed to initialize: RAGPipeline.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'inference_engine'
- ❌ System integration test failed

## Recommendations
- 💡 Optimize model inference or increase hardware resources
- 💡 Optimize memory usage or increase available RAM
- 💡 Improve educational content validation and model fine-tuning
- 💡 model_manager: Check model files and dependencies
- 💡 inference_engine: Check inference engine configuration
- 💡 rag_pipeline: Check RAG pipeline configuration
- 💡 Check component interactions and data flow

## Next Steps
⚠️ Address issues before production deployment
